# 3spire_GSA
3spire is an agent-based model (ABM) with farming household agents whose management decisions are motivated by their desire to satisfice along three aspirational dimensions: food self-sufficiency, income, and leisure. The farmersâ€™ opportunities and outcomes are dependent on their social network, knowledge, assets, household needs, current farm management, land use, and climate and market trends. 

This repository contains the latest version of 3spire and the scripts for analysing model outcomes for a global sensitivity analysis. More information will follow later...
